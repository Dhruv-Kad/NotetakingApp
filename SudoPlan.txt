End goal = Have a system that enables me to take notes on the linux chromebook with a slow internet connection but great battery life, and upload them to remnote on the windows machine, which has a fast internet connection but a good battery life.

STEPS = Take notes on chromebook terminal => Transfer to online repo => Redownload on windows machine and automate upload to remonote => Delete text files

OF NOTE:
	Remote converts .txt files to PDFs by default
	
THINGS TO TRY:
	Student free offers for remote repo hosting [check]

GITHUB:
	Public repos (Don't really want public notes all out there)
BITBUCKET:
	Unlimited private repos as a student

REVISED PLAN:

	Take notes on chromebook, git push to bitbucket, convert to remnote rems

WHAT DO I NEED TO MAKE:

	Script that reads text files, and then
